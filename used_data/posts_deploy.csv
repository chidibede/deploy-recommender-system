4,7,167,Task 2, A Summary on The  idongesit html  CV  Its Structure and Tags        A HTML page is built using tags so first I need to explain what a tag is  A tag is a command in a web page that tells the browser to do something  Tags are enclosed in less than     and greater than     signs     For example   title    this marks the beginning of the tag while   title  which comes with a backslash marks the end of the tag  Any tag can be ended with a backslash    The first thing is the DOCTYPE declaration of the document           html lang  en          All this is doing is saying that this is the start of a HTML document              Additionally  it specifies the language of the document  which is English      head       meta charset  UTF 8            Declaration of the character encoding  UTF 8          meta name  viewport  content  width device width  initial scale 1 0        meta http equiv  X UA Compatible  content  ie edge        title This shows the page title and can be seen on a browser window     title      Marks the start of the part of a HTML document called the head  This section is not visible on the webpage but it carries important information about the document       head      body       This represents the content of the document        body      html    This tag ends every HTML document       In the idongesit html document  the image was called from Cloudinary  a cloud based image and video management solution    The div tag is used to mark a group of consecutive elements    The p tag represents a paragraph  The small element represents small prints   The hr element represents a paragraph level break   The br element represents a line break   The mark element represents a run of text in one document marked or highlighted for reference purposes   The strong element represents strong importance for its content        My Portfolio Screenshots           storage 167 images img 6rxa8iuad0 png                storage 167 images img z4c94u9opo png            storage 167 images img 6a7hflya3v png 
5,8,329,My Journey on HTML,Using the Hyper Text Markup Language  HTML  has been super cool with HNG   I have learnt to arrange elements into header  body and footer elements   I learnt to define structures using headings  h1 to h6   paragraphs p  when needed  I learnt the use of tags  opening  closing and self closing tags   I learnt to use hyperlinks in attribute   I also learnt to use tables  table structures head  body  footer   table rows tr   table data td    I learnt to list items using unordered list ul  and ordered list ol   I used unordered list in my HTML page too  I used the strong  emphasized text and bold tags respectively  I enjoyed every bit of it      storage 329 images img pl9l04lioy png

16,25,54,The Journey with StartNG  Creating my CV with pure HTML,In my previous post  I talked about all the interesting things i have learnt so far  In this post  I will be talking about my experience using HTML   I must admit  it was pretty tough at first because I never imagined there will be a day when I will use HTML without using CSS  After being familiar with using grids rows and columns to style pages  using tables was a virgin experience for me and I must say  I am really impressed with myself   I discovered how to use several attributes in html that could be used for styling without using as in line styling css or linked css file  amongst them were the font  size  face and valign attributes   You know  I could go on and on about all I was able to accomplish using HTML  but I think I would rather show you instead   Below is my CV using just HTML            storage 54 images img ny41o4pks1 png 
17,26,619,What i have done so far on start ng, p When I embarked on this internship  i wouldn t be termed as a complete beginner with regards to HTML and CSS  so the classes and tasks went relatively smoothly for me  But  even at that  there was still so much to learn  like how to take a full web page screenshot and i also got to improve on my HTML skills

26,37,1929,The Journey so far,I just created my first html page guys       I am so stoked  This isn t the first time I m trying it out but I actually saw this through  you must be beginning to think that I am really bad at getting my tasks done  I actually am   After procrastinating my life and time away I actually got through with creating my first html page       HTML is actually not so tough  I m not saying that it s easy  don t get me wrong but with the help of the classes  both theoretical and practical   I have been able to create my first html page  When starting out this task  I had to first declare the type of document it was  i e html5  after which  I then had to write out my head and body opening and closing tags  This enables me to create a html page that will be pleasant to the eyes of those that will be viewing it  The head and body tags weren t the only tags I made use of  I also made use of the table tags  the break line tag  the ordered and unordered list tags to mention a few  I also learnt how to include comments in my IDE  Comments are not exactly viewed on the page  No  they re meant for other developers  if they are just so curious  to be able to understand what exactly goes on in different parts of my code  It has been a refreshing experience so far  I didn t feel like throwing my laptop or phone away and so I believe it s safe for me to say that I look forward to the next task      storage 1929 images img ar11nf4kt png 
27,39,888,HTML  The journey so far ,HTML  HyperText Markup Language  is a language used to create websites  It s been an interesting dive into HTML so far  I designed a site with just HTML with the content being my CV and it taught me how to use a couple of tags that I didn t fully understand       storage 888 images img pxv8wyq3zm png

29,41,231,My CV using HTML,This week s task opened my eyes to a possibility i never thought of  I was able to write my CV using HTML elements  I started off by using the header element  h1  to create my name as the heading of my CV  It is interesting to see how possible it was to use the  ul  elements consisting of  li  to list my work experience  education  and skills   I also observed how raw it looked because they was no styling on the it  The challenging part of this task for me is writing articles  I stopped writing a long time ago  because i lost the inspiration to write  The task has given me the necessary push to get me writing again   Basically i concluded my CV using the footer element  I am getting more familiar with the HTML elements   Thank you

42,62,1133,Towards Becoming a Software Engineer  A case Study of my Journey with HNG,     storage 1133 images img zplxyakz2a png       It has always been a dream of mine to have a platform where I can develop into a complete Software Developer  Studying with HNG and and its wonderful mentors has really been of immense help in this programming journey  The seamless provision of easy to use and understand materials is top notch and the response time to queries is very commendable           Few days into the program and we are already in task 2  here I will be sharing my experience so far on this task 2 because when this task 2 was announced I felt a bit awkward because of the timing but guess what   then comes the materials to assist novice like me and the rest they say is history as I was able to use html to write my CV in a text editor using computer codes as well as upload my portrait on the same page  my joy knew no bounds seeing the positive effects of what I have accomplished when I refreshed my chrome browser to see the changes         This has further uplifted my spirit and confidence towards becoming a complete Software developer  It may seem tough at the beginning but the journey gets interesting along the way especially with the help of the HNG mentors 
43,63,1134,HTML Course so far on startdotng,On Start ng I have learnt the HTML document structure  The structuring of a Html page consists of the following       DIVs which are block level elements  block level elements begin on a new line  stacking on top of each other and take up any available width  while SPANs are inline level elements  inline level elements follow the normal document flow and only take up the width of their content        The major sections of pages include the head  body Artcile  Section and Aside  and the footer     IDs and Classes which are attributes used in identifying and grouping elements when styling      Forms which are used to receive information of the website  It includes input fields with types depending on the type of data needed      Tags are used to define specific elements e g the body tags which defines the body of the html document etc     It is very IMPORTANT to close tags after opening them except incases of tags that dont need a close tag e g the image tag     Comments are important in writing HTML code just so another person finds it easier to read and understand your code  Below is a project on structuring My Curriculum Vitae with HTML       storage 1134 images img pv7ae8w980 png

62,96,116,OVERVIEW OF MY HNG PRE INTERNSHIP EXPERIENCE  THE JOURNEY SO FAR,  OVERVIEW OF MY HNG PRE INTERNSHIP EXPERIENCE  THE JOURNEY SO FAR      I joined up for the   HNG pre   internship program on Sunday  18th August 2019  and so far it s been interesting  and challenging  I am still struggling to get used to the deadlines  the workplace at   Slack   and the program as a whole  but one thing is sure  if I do persevere I should be able to come out of this program a better and more refined person  This post is an update on what has been done so far              What I have learnt so far             What I wish to still learn             Desired Improvements    So here s what my experience has been so far       WHAT I HAVE LEARNED      SO FAR      The first thing I learnt networking  how to reach out and communicate with people you have never met before  this was made possible by the Slack application  a collaborative tool for teams to communicate and share ideas  This was my first time hearing about it and using it  so naturally I found it a tad challenging but with the help of the mods Administrators and very helpful fellow interns I finally got the hang of it  I learnt about linking pages this was part of a task given to us  it did take me a while to figure it  but thankfully I did       WHAT I WISH TO LEARN      I came to learn core programming  Front end application development and maybe later add Android apps development  I also wish to improve on my social skills  how I communicate with people and build a very productive network filled with intellectuals       WHAT I WISH SHOULD BE IMPROVED        I feel certain adjustments should be made to the timetable  if classes could be held in the evenings it will bring in a lot of calm and fluidity to the internship scheme  I also wish to suggest a reduction on the amount of site we get to sign up on  some of these sites are not so easy to navigate  leading to wastage of bandwidth                  Well there are obvious difficulties with updating the Lucid blog  The tasks are also strange and difficult to follow  I wish the pace can be slowed down a bit so people can follow it  Thanks for reading 
63,97,116,BABY STEPS TO BECOMING A PROGRAMMER,Hey guys   so after completing task 1 which I told you guys about in my previous post  I was moved to the next stage of my Start ng pre internship program  needless to say that it wasn t easy finishing the first task  I had to shuttle between actively searching for a job  taking lessons and completing the task  Lucky me has found a balance and will keep advancing in that stride  After the completion of the first task  we were introduced to   HTML      HTML   stands for   Hypertext Markup Language    It allows users create and structure sections  paragraphs  headings  links  and block quotes for web pages and applications  HTML is not in itself a programming language  but it makes it possible to organize and format documents called HTML documents  similarly to Microsoft Word  HTML documents are files that end with a    html   or   _ htm _  extension  They can be viewed by using any web browser  Chrome  Uc browser  Opera mini  or Mozilla Firefox   The browser reads the contents of the HTML file and renders its content so that internet users browsers can view it  Usually  a website is a collection of related pages so using html means one has to create a lot of pages with different HTML content  For instance  home pages download pages  upload pages would all have separate HTML documents     Now to write or create html documents  you will need an online text editor such as visual studio code  note    Dreamweaver  Amaya and sublime text 3just to mention a few  I use Visual studio for my HTLM because I found it easy to understand and also because it was recommended  As part of task 2  we were asked to create a web page named after our full name wand with our CV as the content of that single web page  here s what mine looks like                storage 116 images img gz14gkh0dn png      Like all programming protocols languages  HTML requires loads and loads of practice to master   I am certain that with enough practice and dedication  I can become a professional at web design using HTM  I do hope you have enjoyed my post today  remember to follow me  I follow right back   THANKS  
64,99,1160,PROGRESS SO FAR, p I joined Startng on the 16th of August 2019   p   p At first  it felt like everything was happening really fast but putting down this post has made me realize that just within two days  I have learnt things I actually never knew  I did not know   
65,100,1160,Nigeria and Data, p If we focus on gathering information about the Economy and Welfare of citizens  not only would we provide job opportunities for Data Analysts but we would build a nation that can make strategic and well informed decisions that benefits every single Citizen

77,118,461,My First Html  The journey,The journey so far  has been good   There have been plenty misconceptions  as regarding how to solve or fix grading issues  nevertheless we move regardless   If you thought writing a cv with Microsoft Word Document was difficult  _think again_   I indulge you to take your time with grasping everything I say type   HTML  HyperText Markup Language is very straightforward to grasp  but the issue is in knowing when and why to use the syntax   How I learnt to quickly put all the necessary syntax to use  was by imaging it as plain text written on a blank document either on notes word document   Simply put  when writing an article essay you already know the format at which you re going for i e which text is going to be either a paragraph or heading   In all kinds of documents  structure is very important in helping readers to understand the messages you are trying to convey and to navigate around the document  So  in order to learn how to write web pages  it is very important to understand how to structure documents     With that being said  _it makes work_ _easier_ to start initial task   When compiling  this CV project  Here are the list of things I did   1   I made use of elements  elements are usually made of two tags  the opening and the closing tags  2   Anything written between the    title    tags will appear in the title bar  or tabs  at the top of the browser window  3   Anything written between the    body    tags will appear in the main browser window  4   The use of    strong    elements indicates that the element has strong importance  5   The    table    element is used to create a table   However  the various elements used helped in forming structure in making my cv        storage 461 images img ahvrfhhu9n png

84,125,1167,How I created my CV using just HTML  No CSS or JS ,So I want to mention a few points you need to keep at heart when creating an html document       1   Semantics  HTML has a somewhat loose way of being interpreted by the browser  So your document could be visually cool  but still be a complete wreck structurally  For example  using the  div  tag with plain text in it would give the similitude of a  p  tag  You may ask   if it gets the job done  why worry about all that   I d tell you    it makes your document  since it is indeed meant to be a document  more logical and accessible by screen readers  Trust me  you don t want a lawsuit like  this one  https   www hollywoodreporter com thr esq beyonces parkwood entertainment sued 1172909   It also helps your Search Engine Optimization  SEO    Read more about semantics  https   www lifewire com why use semantic html 3468271  2   Specificity  It s good to use classes and ID s when creating your html document  it s better to use them intelligently  Using ID names that will clearly define the section it is being used for will help your document structure  For example  using an ID  header section  for the introductory section of the document is quite better than using  num1   Also  remember an ID is meant only to be used on a single unique element  If you want to use an identifying name for more than one element  you should give those elements a class name instead  3   Indentation  There s nothing as frustrating as reading illegible lines of code    trust me  there isn t  When writing your html code  as with an other code  ensure you indent properly so as to make your code more legible and make errors easier to trace  It is easier to understand the structure of a document when it is properly indented than when clustered up   It is easier for me to find the error in this    div    h3 class  title  Biswal Limited  Lagos   Field Maintenance Engineer  h3    small class  date  January 2016   p class  role  Role  The company offers maintenance services to telecommunications clients  p     div       Than in this    div  h3 class  title  Biswal Limited  Lagos   Field Maintenance Engineer  h3  small class  date  January 2016 p class  role  Role  The company offers maintenance services to telecommunications clients  p   div           Both are missing the closing   small  tag  but it s easier for me to trace that in a well indented code  Here are screenshots of an html document created as my CV  Enjoy        storage 1167 images img d0znfzxvbz png            storage 1167 images img 00xqcgroya png                storage 1167 images img 2emx3lerq3 png                storage 1167 images img igkt5aj82t png            storage 1167 images img ztwmksfoz4 png            storage 1167 images img i4goq0a6e7 png 
85,126,1802,What i have done so far on Start Ng,The internship program has been an exciting journey  We have been attending classes  via the slack channel   I must commend the level of organization using technology platforms like slack  google and other mediums  It has shown clearly   how innovative the organizers have been   From this process  i have learnt a lot of things and i will mention theme below      1   Anything is possible if you can think of it   2   We have not fully understood and utilize the power of technology in all of our business dealing   3   The grading system used on this channel is awesome   4   The concept of giving every one a task and letting them to complete the task and having mentors has been awesome   5   There has been a level of decorum and management on the part of the organizers   6   This program can build confidence even in someone who cannot code   7   In order to attain fulfillment you must be of service to others   8   There is potential power in team work  as the program encourages team   9   In the task we are encouraged to write our experience while undergoing this internship  It is also a novel idea  a it encourages   one to improve his her thought patterns  writing skills and presentation skills  As minute as write on a blog is  it involves critical thinking  if  you are wiling to write something that makes sense and could be read by others   10   The reward system is awesome from my experience in managing people  what i can take home from this is    people get excited when you reward them for things they have been able to achieve in no small capacity  This program rewards people with a token for their hardwork and trying to help others succeed  Wonderful idea     11   Lastly  i can code  although i have been learning this on my own  however it feels good putting into practice what you have been      I know there so much to learn ahead  and i am more than ready to be part of this and get full internship as we go along   We meet at the top                  storage 1802 images img bmesy7axtw png      storage 1802 images img ch00e678rk png

88,129,1833,PRE HNG INTERNSHIP  WHAT I LEARNT IN TASK TWO 2 ,Barely one week ago  i luckily found a community of like minded persons that could help make my programming education easier  Its worthy of note that its been over a year that i have been looking for a way to learn this  however the Start ng pre internship became the answer i always needed       We are in the second week but i have learnt so much within such a small time frame  For instance  in the task 2  i learnt the following           How to build my portfolio website  which is of utmost important while searching for job or contracts      How to use HTML only to build a beautiful site using tags like  hr    a    footer    br  e t c     I learnt three ways to screenshot screen pages     i learnt how to use Github and how Git basics            storage 1833 images img laa1l74djv png           Attached above is the screenshot of the CV i built using html  Its been an awesome experience and i am eager to learn more 
89,130,1089,First HTML Project,    HWGA  HWGA is not a new programming language  It s my personal code for when I feel frustrated  It means _Here we go again _  with a face palm obviously     It also means that I am growing  Growth is not comfortable  The first HTML Project was given immediately after class  At the time  I was still fumbling around with getting lucid and blogger right  It was a humbling experience  However  I was able to get this done but I was already behind far schedule       HTML  I finally got down to writing the HTML  HTML is Hypertext Markup Language  According to Mozilla Development Network    HTML  HyperText Markup Language  is the most basic building block of the Web  It defines the meaning and structure of web content  Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page s appearance presentation  CSS  or functionality behavior  JavaScript    It refers to links that connect web pages to one another  either within a single website or between websites  Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web  By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people  you become an active participant in the World Wide Web    I wrote the HTML code  followed the hint of the mentors and used table to style the content  Admittedly  the table has been a saviour  Without it my  website  would have been Hiroshima after the bomb   I used border attribute to structure the table because the instruction was to use no CSS  Here are the screenshots of the page        storage 1089 images img 2htmpzlclm png        storage 1089 images img bpg8x5x8e8 png        storage 1089 images img 1ps0caycqi png        storage 1089 images img zp6hcwz7ep png        storage 1089 images img v70ya88jxk png      storage 1089 images img tzfm9iv28v png      storage 1089 images img 2dyfqh8wwf png 
90,131,350,And the journey begins,Learning to code is much like building a house one must first lay a solid foundation  Without understanding the basics of programming  learning more complex concepts will be very difficult and there s no better place to learn how to code from scratch like StartNG where we are provided with super helpful mentors and surrounded by like minded peers     This week we started from the very alpha Html  A mark up language used to create what is called the skeleton of any webpage or software s documents to be displayed in a web browser  We learned the various html elements and how to use them  After the class we were given a task to test our knowledge on the html elements  we were asked to recreate our resume with html the best we could  I would have dropped a screenshot of my work but i am currently unable to because Lucid is in testing phase and so the upload feature is not functional at the moment  I promise to show you guys as soon as possible so you can see my work of art

99,140,1659,Introduction To HTML,What is HTML                    HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language  HTML is not a language in the traditional sense  but in the sense that it is a tool made of keywords and commands that programmers use to communicate with computers  HTML is used by web designers to create websites like Facebook  Twitter  and Hubpages  These examples also use various other tools  but for someone first learning about designing websites  HTML is the first tool that they should learn how to use     In order to write HTML  you will need a text editor  A text editor is different from programs like Word that are meant for writing books or essays  Programs like word have helpful tools like paragraph styling and auto caps  but those tools are not helpful for writing HTML  in fact  they can make it very difficult to do so  Never use Word to write HTML  On the other hand  text editors often have tools designed specifically for programming  There are many text editors out there  but I will focus on the three that I have used the most          storage 1659 images img epcirs106v png           Notepad and TextEdit                          Notepad  or TextEdit if you use a mac  is probably the most basic a text editor gets  and it is very easy to create and edit an HTML file with either of these programs  The downside is that neither Notepad or TextEdit offer any helpful tools writing HTML  but if you just want to write something quick and simple  then either of these would be sufficient to get the job done           Create an HTML File                         Once you have chosen an editor  open it up and create a new file  and save it as index html  all lowercase   The   html  tell internet browsers that this file contains HTML  and the name  index  tells the browsers that this will be your websites default home page  You can actually open this file in your web browser now and view it  but it would just be an empty page  so let s add some text to it  Go ahead and copy and paste the text below into your index html file              DOCTYPE html          html   lang      en             head             head            body         Hello World        WELCOME TO MY WEBSITE            body             html              View Your File in a Browser                                 I will explain what each line means  but first let s see what your website looks like  Go ahead and save your file again  To open your file in a browser  right click on the file and select  open with   then select your browser  see image below        Open with browser  https   usercontent1 hubstatic com 13880528_f496 jpg     Your browser should open up to a page similar to the image below             Hello world  https   usercontent1 hubstatic com 13880520 png _H_    Congratulations  you have created a simple website  It may not look like much now  but all websites start off small  and with a little more time and effort we can make it into something much prettier     Explaining the Code                         Now  I wouldn t be a very good teacher if I didn t explain the code we just used  so let s go ahead and jump right into it  Open you file again  and we ll go over the code line by line  If your file opens in a browser when you try clicking it  right click the file and select  open with  again  but this time select your editor instead of a browser     This first line simply tells the browser what programming language the file is in              DOCTYPE html      These two lines are called opening and closing tags  An opening tag tells the browser when a specific section of your website will begin  and the closing tags tells where it will end  It is traditional to indent any lines placed between matching tags so that your text is easier to understand  pressing tab on your keyboard will create an indent on the currently selected line  These specific tags are called HTML tags  and they tell the browser that everything between them is HTML  The  lang  en  part is so the browser knows to expect the inside text to be in English                         html lang    en            html      These are the head tags  Text placed between these tags will not appear on your website  This section is where the code goes that tells the browser what the website s title is  where to get styling tools like special fonts  and where the tab icon for your website is stored  For this project  we will leave this section empty                   head         head            Anything that you want to appear on your website you will place between these body tags  This will be the  body  of your website                   body               body            This is plain text  any plain text placed inside your body tags will appear on the website  Some special character like     will not appear on your website  but they are possible to show using character references  For example   Tom  amp  Jerry  will look like  Tom   Jerry  on your website                  Hello World        WELCOME TO MY WEBSITE       All together  these tools can be used to create a simple website              DOCTYPE html        html lang    en           head         head        body       Hello World        WELCOME TO MY WEBSITE          body         html            Thank You for Reading                           Thank you

174,230,403,My first Post while on StartNG pre internship ,Hello world  What can I say about my experience so far in the pre internship  First what do I know about the StartNG re internship  Its a remote program hosted by HNG  to help train professional developers in Front end  back end  machine learning  digital skills  amongst others  So far so good I am going through some tasks to enable me learn a little in digital skills   I already have a little experience in working remotely  as i am a self taught Developer working as a UI UX Developer  The thing is I want to relearn some of the things I started out with  get back to the basics  these days we lose touch with what is really important when trying to reach a set goal  And sometimes skip important lessons   There were some questions asked by different mentors in the groups in the form of games in which getting it right earns you a reward  That is a plus  Those that don t get the answer fast enough or don t answer at all pick up one or two things from what others have dropped  I am learning a little more on tweeting and blogging   It isn t easy to handle a bunch of us learners with our questions  our unintended ungrateful retorts and assumptions  I believe there is always room to improve when it comes to imparting knowledge  so far the whole team is doing good managing us on the slack group  I believe we should always try to reach out to more and more people and teach them all these things as startng HNG are   I think the the lucid platform is a nice piece of work though it is progressing a little slowly  I saw a post from Mentor Mark Essien earlier  stating that laravel developers can join in the project in order to improve on it  also the  lucid _feedback channel in slack is available for feedback on the platform   I am grateful to be in this platform reading refreshing questions and relative answers that help ground me even further in what i still believe I am great at

255,327,2227,A Developer s Journey,Lao Tzu once said   the journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step   Whatever we want to accomplish in life always has a starting point  The place where it all began       For as long as I can remember  I ve been around computers  I played games mostly with them  but I learned a couple of skills as well  I learned how to type really quickly at a young age  and  considering that back then most of my peers did even know where the letters of the alphabet were on the keyboard  I fancied myself a whiz  A computer genius       As I grew up  I began to discover that my computing skills were barely scratching the surface  and there was a lot more to a computer than just knowing how to type  I had told myself that I was a genius for so long that it made me relax too much  I was way behind       So I decided to step up my game  I took a lot of courses mostly in graphic design  watched hours of Youtube videos  and got better at design  I decided to learn how to build websites so I could market my skills to a wider audience  and after watching a couple more videos  trying and failing so many times  I have made it to this point  Start Ng       There are a couple of things I ve learned so far         Software Development is Broad    There is no single person on this earth that can come out and say that he she knows everything there is to know about software development  There are so many programming languages  skillsets  frameworks and tools to use that it is easy to get lost in it if there s no proper guidance         Development Skills Matter  People Skills are Extremely Important    Since I started on the HNG Pre internship  I ve had the opportunity to meet a lot of talented developers and designers  who are all eager to learn  and one thing I ve discovered about them is that nobody claims to know everything  Everyone is just out to help each other grow  make meaningful connections and form strong bonds that go beyond software development  I has helped me to work more on my people skills and become more emphatic and realize that I m never alone         Writing Skills are important too    Since I started on this intership  I ve had to write two blogs  That is more than I ve ever written in my life in one week  I ve had to do a lot of research on what works and what doesn t  and also how to organize my thoughts  It s been an enjoyable journey so far  and I think I m beginning to love writing  Who knew right         Working Towards Goals    I ve spent a lot of time trying to learn how to design and code  and the major problem I usually have is that I finish up my tutorial videos  I am easily distracted  However  having a set of tasks and a time frame as start ng provides has helped to make me more focused and now I can confidently say that not only am I finishing up my tasks in record time  but I am also enjoying the workflow       I am very grateful that I have been given this opportunity to learn  and I wish that by the end of this program  I will turn out to be a very good frontend developer  with amazing people skills  and a lot of confidence in my capacity       There really isn t much I think should be improved on for now  everything is okay and I love it  Thanks start ng

278,352,7,SHALLOW THINKING,It s quite easy to be good enough at something that everyone around you praises you  For example  you can read a few books  do a couple of courses and everyone will see you as a 3D printing guru  But that s mostly because nobody else knows anything about 3D   In a place without a large density of engineers  it s very easy to do this  It s easy to claim you are good at hardware hacking  or SEO or Google Adwords  and because almost nobody knows what these things are or is good at doing them  you are instantly seen as a guru   People will start inviting you to give talks  your peers will refer to you as  that genius   people will be hailing you   You can t stop the above from happening  but the most destructive mistake anyone can make is to actually start believing it   It s relatively easy to become better than the people around you at almost anything  It s actually trivially easy  But you will never  ever be good if those people are your yardstick for your own success   A good way to know you are stuck in being slightly better than beginners is when you tend to teach beginners  novices or people who are just starting   If you are truly good  you will be teaching intermediates or experts  Never beginners  The biggest coaches are always training experts  never starters   To not fall into this trap  you have to avoid interacting with beginners till you have reached the advanced level  It sounds harsh  but if you don t do this  you will tend to compare yourself down instead of comparing yourself up  So you will see all you have achieved  which is very comforting   instead of all you have not achieved  which is much harder to look at    Once you are at an advanced level  then you can start teaching others  and you are now teaching it much better   I see this phenomena all too often   people looking for the praise and kudos of non experts  They get it  and in the process condemn themselves to never become experts 
279,353,7,TWO YEARS IN THE TRENCHES BUILDING HOTELS NG,Hotels ng is about two years old now  In the first year  it was just a website   no business built around it  It started off by me purchasing lists of hotels  The entirety of hotels that were available in any known dataset that was available in public or in any government archive was about 1500 in Nigeria  I listed them all on the site and put the site up  Only 100 of those hotels had pictures  The pictures were scraped from the hotel websites   In October 2012 I moved to Nigeria to try to build a business out of this hotel booking website  I landed  rented a flat in calabar and convinced a friend of mine  Charles  to join the project  I and Charles hit the streets of Calabar and started snapping photos of the hotels in Calabar  Soon we had the largest online list of hotels in Calabar  But none were yet bookable   We coded a booking form one day and bought a company phone  We turned on the booking form and put the phone number on the site  We received 20 bookings for hotels in various parts of Nigeria that day  and had 100 missed calls on the phone  We could not book the hotels yet and we barely had time to address all the queries we received  so we took the number back off  We kept the booking form  but nothing would happen when people booked   Some time later  Jason Njoku wrote me a message on Facebook that he was starting an investment company called Spark and that he wanted to invest in Hotels ng  I went to Lagos  we had a 30 minute meeting on a hot balcony together with Bastian  then I returned to Calabar  The next day  they made an offer  A bit of negotiation and in January 2013 Hotels ng received funds from Spark   In the last 1 year  I used the investment money to build Hotels ng into a company  We have 15 full time staff  5 contract staff and more than 70 ad hoc staff  Those 70 people went everywhere in Nigeria and got hotels on our site  We now have 5080 hotels on the site  We have full pictures for 4000  of all those hotels  We have addresses and driving instructions for all these hotels   we have massively accelerated the move of an African industry online   The total value of the bookings that we have done for hotels in Nigeria on our website alone is currently 2 3 million USD  That value was generated without spending any money marketing the site  By its very existence  it is useful and people patronize it without us needing to tell them to use it   By the end of the year 2013 we hit  40k in monthly revenue  I will follow up this post with other posts detailing how the process has been   How has it been building a tech startup in Nigeria  Everyone always on the outside tries to show how their startup is doing awesome and taking over the market and all what not  but that s not how it is on the inside   The past two years have been like climbing a mountain   blindfolded  To do what we are doing  there is no roadmap  There is no book teaching how to create something that has never existed in this market before  So it was all experiments and trial and error  I never knew what would work and what would not  so we would need to spend to test out different things to find what seems to work good  And even when you find something that works  you need growth  so you need to find what works even better   From composing the teams  deciding how to approach hotels  getting people across 36 states in Nigeria  figuring out how to book hotel rooms with hotels without internet  and even the small stuff like getting our own internet working  it has all been a journey of uncertainty         GETTING STARTED WITH  50K    Our initial raise was  75k  of which  25k went to buy a car  to close deals in Lagos   So we had  50k to deploy people across Nigeria and pay a team of 12 people  That s N8 million  At the time  I though that it would be more than enough  But quickly I realised that things were far more expensive than you think they are  If you have N8mill for 6 months  you have about 1 3m per month  Salaries will take half that money  Developer will take a big chunk  Data purchase another big chunk  The money will finish very rapidly   So we had to do another raise with Spark  this time  150k  In the first 6 months  the sheer amount of things that needed to be set up and built meant that it would have been very hard to build the neccessary relationships to raise any kind of investment from other parties   My take away from the initial raising money is this  If you are going to raise money for something complicated  make sure the money will last at least 1 year  You will need 6 months to build a lot of the processes and start generating revenue and another 6 months to build the relationships you need close your next round         THE INITIAL BUILDING PROCESS    When we first started  I had no idea how to build a team  I had never been in any kind of managerial position with more than 4 people  Initially  we had the system where everything was being controlled by me  After some wise advice from Victor Asemota  I split up into smaller units with team leaders  This was far more efficient and resulted in better performance   Jason and Bastian were very helpful in this phase   they had far more experience than I in managing and hiring  and looking around at what was going on and discussing things with them helped clarify a lot of what the approach should be  Jason told me one of the other useful things I learnt  which is that a low performer in one field can become a high performer if you swap their job roles  So  forgive me for this  co workers   a lot of the initial stages was me moving people around till I could find a good person job fit   During this period  we had to figure out how to make things work  Now it seems so obvious in retrospect how to book hotels  but back then I genuinely did not know  I did not know how to fulfill a booking efficiently  how to approach the hotels to strike a commission deal and how to invoice the hotels in a way that would ensure that they paid us   And most importantly  how do you do this across 4000  hotels without getting confused with the amount of info you are dealing with  The first 6 months was just about building the processes  building the software systems we needed to manage this  figuring out how to field deploy people  etc   The key take aways from this period to me is  The things you do internally  they may seem super easy when you have figured them out  but they are not easy to discover  You cannot copy a company from the outside  Also  very importantly  a word is enough for the wise  When you have a problem  someone with far more experience can tell you just one word and it will make things suddenly fall into place  Talk to people who have more experience than you in the things you are doing   After the first 6 months of furiously building Hotels ng  things started running on their own  I was no longer an essential part of the process  So I took a 2 week holiday in Germany  That holiday was super useful in discovering the parts of my process that were not working well and still needed me  I advice everyone to disconnect from the company for two weeks and observe how well it runs independent of you  If it requires you to be there  then it is not a scalable business   So the day I came back  a tech founder friend of mine called me and said he had to tell me something important  I asked him what he was  He paused  then said  Rocket Internet are building a hotel booking website  It s just like yours   Rocket Internet  The guys with five hundred million dollars  Coming up against me  I had barely  70 000  I started sweating   I had actually pitched those guys a while back to open a hotel booking website in Nigeria  I searched my email for the pitch deck to see if it gave away anything  Reading that document made me realize how different assumptions about a business are from when you actually start the business  That would not help them   How do we beat Rocket Internet  They had everything  Over the following week  I kept thinking about that  But then I noticed something   they kept studying us  trying to find out how we did it  They were trying to beat US   That s when I realised that somehow or the other  barely knowing it  we had become the largest hotel booking website in West Africa  So I didn t have to beat Rocket Internet  they had to beat me   If you think of it in battle terms  at this point we have two armies  both moving in darkness  trying to get as fast as possible to a particular location  The battle has not started  We were in the deployment phase  and we were far ahead   So far  we had moved much faster than them  We had done smart things  Even when they started moving  we were accelerating faster than them by any metric you could count  And at a fraction of what they spent  Our total budget of our 20 man team was not up to the annual salary of their MD alone   So on reflection  I understood how we could beat them  In this movement phase  I will always be faster because they have so far not demonstrated any ability to outsmart us  At some point in the future  both sides would have arrived and it s time to start the actual battle  which involves having the site the customers prefer to use   A lot of that is based on your ability to market wisely and to build a product that delights customers so much that they market it for you  In both of those aspects  if this were something that more money means you must automatically win  then there would be no instagram or snapchat   I don t know what the future will bring  but I know that the team we have at Hotels ng is good enough to win  even against a deep pocket competitor like Rocket  They have been around for 6 months now  and barely dented our number 1 position  The way we move will make it stay that way         THE HASSLES    When you are doing something that is changing the way an old and established market like the hotel industry in Nigeria is  with a lot of old rich men involved  you will face a lot of people who do not understand what you are trying to do   We have faced a lot of hassles from different sectors   from the troubles our inventory guys face to the banks not understanding our business to the police trying to find out more about what we do  to our cars getting arrested   This is Nigeria  This is Africa  This is normal  My advice  Have backup  have friends in high places  because if you truly disrupt  you will need their help to solve problems   The reason so many foreign companies came to Africa and left again is that they could not deal with the problems  You have to know that there will be major problems  and you just solve them and keep going  without ever being distracted from the mission and vision         FIRING PEOPLE    It s not easy to work with someone in close proximity for many months and then fire them  But the role of the CEO of a company is that of a care taker of a company  You are there to do the best for the company  If a person genuinely cannot contribute to a company  a CEO is obliged to lay the person off   I think it is better to just maintain a high standard when hiring and fire fast if you must fire  Because we are all humans and all kind   when you know someone well  you may be hesitant to do what s best for the company because of pity         THE TECH SCENE    What we are building is not in isolation  it s in the middle of the tech scene  This scene has been invaluable for the company and for me  I have never been a big fan of Lagos  but the fact of the matter is that this is where Nigerian tech is going to be  It will cluster in Lagos and likely in Yaba area   Since coming to Lagos  I have met a large number of the  twitter famous  people  Each of those people have straight up provided me with ideas or information  And those words really made a difference   I strongly believe that technology is so complex and wide that without being in a community  it can never really take fruit and become something significant in the countries economy  One person discovers something  tells someone else  And the second person can use that info and connect it to solve a problem with his business   The Nigerian tech community is small  but it is helpful  It needs to grow so that we can build a real technology industry here in the biggest African country  The success of technology in Nigeria will determine the success of technology across the rest of Africa  and in my opinion  I think any continent that is left behind in technology industry will forever fall behind in the global economy   These small apps and websites we are creating now are important for this continent  They have the ability to change and transform it  They are what will create the future industries  So no matter what  we must never stop trying to build a local technology eco system         FINAL WORDS    Building Hotels ng has been hard  But it s worth it to look at the site business and see it working  See people booking hotels every day and it all somehow keeps running  All of this was done with the help of

280,354,2233,HNG Pre internship, p I ve learnt how to start and finish a task  Even when it gets tough to always follow through to the end  It always feels good to start and finish something rather than stopping halfway  I ve also learnt the power of collaboration   
281,355,7,HOW TO AVOID BEING A ONE HIT WONDER,Most people  at some point  have a hit  Some hit blog post  some hit song  some hit startup  some great party and so on  But then that s it  They try again  but it just doesn t work the second time around  They try to do things exactly the same way  but it just does not work  Why is this  Why do some people have consistent hits and keep growing and getting better  while others just have one hit that they can never reproduce     THE FUNDAMENTALS                         Think of some guy cooking dinner  He goes crazy  throwing various ingredients in the pot  roasting the meat on an open flame  flinging whatever he finds in the fridge into the pan  and randomly selects some red wine from the shop   He invites his friends for dinner  and they are astounded  The meal is perfect   the meat is just right  the wine works perfectly  the soups are just perfectly flavored   That guy just landed a hit  But it s a hit he cannot reproduce  He does not know why that meal was so good  because he was just throwing things into the pot  He got lucky with a bit of intuition and some luck  Give him different ingredients  a different stove and he will make a terrible meal   Contrast that with a professional cook  He can consistently give you a good meal  independent of what he has available to him  Sometimes  even the pro will make a dud  but most of the time  it will turn out right   The core difference between them is simply that the professional cook has a good knowledge of the fundamentals  He has studied the theory behind what he is doing  or he has a huge wealth of experience  He knows how to sear meat  he knows the correct spices to mix with a particular dish  So what the other guy did by chance  he can consistently do   Most one hit wonders just don t have the fundamentals  They work based on instinct and even though it may guide them to make a single hit  they will not understand how that hit came about  A person who has studied the fundamentals will see the hit like an insight that has opened new opportunities to him   he will recognize new things  but the other person will take nothing new from the experience     THE SOCIAL NETWORK                           The world is filled with a bunch of extremely smart people  And these people don t want anything to do with you  They don t have the time to talk to any guy off the street  But when you have your hit  they will all want to talk to you  For a while   The person who wants to make more than a single hit has to grasp this opportunity to force his way into the midst of this society  Because these very smart people are what will make your next hit   You can t keep repeating one thing that worked  It gets boring  You can t sing the same song twice and expect it to be another hit  You can t keep cooking the same dish  You can t keep making the same website  You will need to make something new  And your new social network are what will make that second hit for you   It s like Lady Gaga trying to have a hit record  Hundreds of songwriters want her to sing their song  It s easy for her to land another hit  because all the best producers will want to work with her  Her album has taken her into a new social network that she can now leverage to keep her fame high   Some people  after landing their hit  don t attempt to get to know the important people in the new social network  They remain at the same social level that they were at  That means they have to recreate a new hit all over again  That s very difficult     THE HIT FACTORY                        The person who makes hit after hit does so by a combination of two factors   he has the necessary knowledge about the fundamentals  and when he lands that hit that makes him visible  he leverages the new social network this opens to him  He uses the newly available brainpower to him to make the next hit 
282,356,7,BUILD AROUND YOUR DISCOVERY MECHANISM,When you launch your web application  desktop software or any other type of software  the biggest problem you are going to face is very simple  but very hard to solve  People will not find your application   For example  imagine Mr  Huang opens a shoe store and puts it in the corner of the town  in an area where there is no foot traffic  Very few people will find it  he goes broke  and he soon closes down  Mr  Rubenstein  on the other hand  puts the same shoe store on a busy shopping street  People are already there  all he needs to do them is add incentives for them to come in  The first guy has two problems  no people  no incentives  the second guy has one problem only  and he can easily test out different incentives to find the best one   There may be a guy somewhere in Alaska who really really needs your software  You may really really need his money  But he will never find you  This is what will crush your product   the great big silence after launch   Assuming you have not yet started working on your product  there is one thing that will make your life so very much easier  build around your discovery mechanism  Build on a busy shopping street  and not out in the corner of the town   First of all  be very very clear on how you want users to discover your application  Then develop this part first  Then build everything else on top of that  If your application does not match your discovery mechanism  then change one of the two   For example  if you are planning to gain users by search engine traffic  then make sure your product generates a lot of web pages  make sure the webpages interlink  study SEO FIRST  and THEN build your product   If you plan to gain users by word of mouth  then focus on polishing the user experience  People will only recommend highly polished and non frustrating software  Be sure to have some communication method with the initial crop of users   If you plan to gain users by viral growth  then make sure virality is fundamental to your application  and not tacked on   If you plan to gain users because you are in a closed eco system like the Apple app store or Facebook  then find out the fundamental properties of these eco systems  and make sure these are part of your app  For example  in the app store  you should cross promote apps  In facebook  your apps should require more than one person to be useful   Be very clear on how you want your apps to be discovered  Then build your application around this  otherwise your chance of just being ignored is high   Have you ever noticed that a lot of the time several asian restaurants will open right next to each other on the same street  instead of in some other  unserviced  part of town  They do that because in order to survive  they need to be discovered  otherwise they will be killed by the great silence 
283,357,7,ARE YOU CAPABLE OF BEING RUTHLESS TO GET AHEAD ,A few years ago  I was consulting in the technical department of a big company that makes electronics  One day at a company party  a young guy about 24 years old  roughly my age  walked up to me and introduced himself  He was a new recruit and was working in business development  He was funny  charming and intelligent  Over the next 6 months  I would watch him ruthlessly work his way into management  jumping over the heads of people who had been there for years   I ll call him Saul and talk a bit about his methods  because they were efficiently effective   Being ruthless in business is like bringing a gun to a knife fight  People talk about cut throat business  but actually business is pretty civilised and most people are quite nice to each other  So when a ruthless person comes along who is willing to just charge ahead and throw aside who ever stands in his way  for him it s like taking candy from a baby  Or to put it in more realistic terms  taking a lot of money from a soft  slightly pudgy nerd   What I d like to do is list those external attributes that I observed in Saul   and if you can decide if you would be capable of doing the same to be successful   1     Choose your friends    Saul always had a lot friends  but he never stayed friends with people who had not moved up in the ranks with him  For example  when I first knew Saul  he was working as an entry level employee in a large company  He was friends with everyone  He got friendly with the boss  and 6 months later  he was a manager  His old friends said that Saul would walk by them  chatting and laughing with the managers  and it would be like they never existed   A core of Saul s strategy  as he once explained was this   you can t have a million close friends  You need to have close friends that are at your stage in life and higher  and for that  you have to leave the ones that stayed behind back   When Saul needed something  he made sure that he gained as many friends in that particular area as he could  For example  when he made his play to get into management  he first became friends with his boss  and when his boss took him out  Saul got to know all the other managers  and became their friends   When Saul wanted to get to know women  he identified the crowd of fun cool guys who were in contact with the women  and he became their friend  Saul would never pretend to be your friend just so you would fix his computer or something short term like that   he created relationships with the people who would bring him forward   1     Make sure your outwards appearance is perfect    GTL   Gym  Tan  Laundry  Saul said that people will judge you immediately by your outward appearance  and the most profitable investment you can make is in good clothes  good shoes and a good body  He actually wears light make up  It may seem vain  but this strategy gained him a lot of attention from women  and he would use women to climb up the ladder of success   To expand his contacts  he would use his clique of women to gain the attention of the men he was interested in  And for the women to be interested in him  he micro managed his body and dressing to the smallest details   And let s face it   have you seen many top management who look grubby  Being well groomed seems to be an essential attribute of leadership   1     Invest in your location    Saul spent an extra ordinary percentage of his income on his home  He lived cheap and spent a large part of his income paying his rent in an expensive area  and furnishing his place really nicely   One of the most important things he would do then would be to invite people to his home  and when people came in  they would be visibly impressed  and his worth would rise dramatically in their eyes   Saul also had a network of a few locations he frequented where he knew the people and the staff  At any social gathering  Saul would work to navigate the group to these  safe  territories  where he would then be in control of the situation   1     Approach people and tell them what to do    Saul had no fear of approaching people and telling them what to do  Rather than sitting in his desk and waiting for things to happen  Saul would always jump at every opportunity to approach someone and either build a relationship with them  or to do something for them   For example  when new clients were brought on a tour of the company  he stood up and joined the entourage  chatting with the clients  The natural way he did this made it seem normal and accepted  and instantly got him noticed by the Vice President  who was leading the people around the office   1     Keep your head when everyone else is getting caught up in the rush    Whenever there was a panic or something that required swift action  Saul would always sit back and wait  He would not jump into the fray before he was sure what exactly was going on   which led to the impression that he rarely made mistakes   On company outings  Saul would drink just a little  while encouraging everyone else to drink an excessive amount  This would result at some point in him taking over control of the group   and this was key to him assuming a de facto leadership position a few weeks after entering the department   What this brought him  Saul  shortly after arriving at the company became one of the most popular employees in his department  He was regularly going out for drinks with the head of department  and after a couple of months  she promoted him to something with an office  I m not sure what   Then she changed department  and because he had become the de facto leader of the group  she recommended him for her job  He took over the job  and became close friends with most of the mid level management  After a couple of months of hard work  he threatened to transfer to another branch unless he would be promoted  He was promoted after a negotiation period   Now  five years later I heard he s running a department with more than a thousand people below him  When people talk about him  they don t dislike him  they are just awed by the way he aggressively moved ahead  By building relationships  and by ending relationships when they were hampering him  he was able to achieve a lot of what he had told me as he arrived that he wanted to achieve 
284,358,1235,My First HTML Page,  HTML So Far      Learning HTML during this HNG internship programs has allowed to know more about the language and it has also introduced me to new tags and attributes used in the language  The assignment to format our resume in HTML also brought clarity to the usage of some of these tags  Although it took a while to get my hand wrapped around some methodologies  it however was an experience that I totally enjoyed           I have however realized from this training that there are several ways to achieve a task but some routes are better and with the help of some of the mentors and class members  it was a hitch free journey to coding my first script           Some of the things I learnt was format each heading with different sizes with the  h   assigning information to paragraphs with  p  tag  the  li  tag was used to list items in the HTML page  the table tag was used to arrange information in a table arrangement and how to aesthetically arrange the codes to easily review it                       storage 1235 images img yqbdui04pi png 
285,359,7,DO YOU NEED A CO FOUNDER ,Co founders are both the most important thing that your company needs and the most likely reason your company will fail  If you don t have any co founders  when you hit that dip  that speed bump along the road  you will be unable to continue  There will be nobody to talk to  nobody to brainstorm with  nobody who will come up with fresh ideas or new ways of doing things  When the customers are complaining  when you hit an impossible bug  without a co founder  it is easy to give up or just bury your head in unimportant work   But with a co founder  the situation can be even worse  It s a bit like being married   if the marriage works out well  it s way better than being single  But if the marriage turns out terrible  being single would be heavenly   A while back when I was consulting in the DirectX area  I had a client called Eric  He was a soft spoken guy  incredibly nice  but he always had this air of sadness around him  Once  we were chatting in the evening  and he suddenly started telling me his life story  He had been running a software business with a co founder from college  and the business had just started taking off  Suddenly  his co founder started acting over bearing and trying to get Eric to reduce his share of the business  They started fighting  they disagreed on some core features  and at some point  Eric came back home and he could not access the servers  An ugly battle started then that ended with Eric being ousted from the company in exchange for some cash   The co founders of small startups have very personal relationships  The line between family  friendship and work blurs completely and they intersect and merge with each other  Flaws in people become magnified when people get that close  Just like the biggest fights can be between brothers  people who have their lives so intertwined can get into big battles about unimportant things     HOW CO FOUNDERS SHOULD BE                                  Imagine you were in some 16th century tavern  having an ale and then a man walks in and says   which of you men here is ready to join me in war  and have your chance at fame and fortune  You will immediately size up the man and decide   can I do battle with this man by my side  Can I follow this man  Can I trust this man  Will this man be smart enough to actually make me achieve fame and fortune  or will he leave me to bleed to death in some field   A person who instills confidence in you in all of those questions is the person you want to co  found a company with   And yes  a partnership is never really equal  There has to be someone who is somewhat more equal than others  There is nothing more devastating than a partnership were all the members have exactly equal rights and votes  This just does not work  Human society and all monkeys always have a single individual at the top and with all others  even though they are almost equal  being not quite equal   Any company where several people believe they should have final say or be consulted on final say is usually going to fail with a bunch of arguments and fights  The partnership may actually work very well in this mode so long no money I d bring made  but as soon as there is cash  the clashes will start   There has to be a clear and obvious leader who has final say within every company  That s just how the big apes roll     SO YOU WANT TO START A COMPANY  HUH                                              Don t just go for the obvious co founder person around you  You may have some guy you know who is somewhat good in IT  this should not be your cofounder just because he lives near you   Spend some time getting out there and meeting people and finding out who you are compatible with  Form short term collaborations on small projects and websites and see with whom you can work the best  When you want to get serious with a co founder  make sure you have really worked together for a while   When you have someone you want to work with  you will know pretty quickly  It s like meeting the right girl   you know quite quickly this is the person for you  But to find that person  you need to have met a lot of the wrong people first  Few people are lucky enough to meet the right person straight away  or to have the perfect person be your childhood friend     PROFESSIONALISM AS A WAY OF DOING THINGS                                                 Crazy Internet startups where everyone is really chummy with each other are great way to start a company  but it does not scale  Close personal relationships means that people will get into fights  and in small companies  this can be devastating to morale and your productivity  As a company grows  relationships should be formalized  People who are friends should be friends  but people who are not the types likely to be friends should not be forced to do this   Work should be governed by mutual respect between the people working  It will seem as if the tone of the company is becoming more drab  but taking away the biggest highs also takes away the lowest lows  And the company in the end is there to make money  and this works best when everyone feels comfortable at work  are able to be as quirky as they naturally are without getting in the hair of other people  and has their space to be productive in     THE STORY OF ERIC  COMPLETED                                     Eric  after having been kicked out of his company had hired me as a consultant to build his new software  I got a salary to do the code and also to talk with him about the software  He would come up with a business strategy and ask my opinion  and together we designed a good business model   When the software was done  he said thank you and gave me a nice bonus  He launched the software and now  a few years later  he is one of the biggest players in the media world  I did a lot of follow up work and watched as he basically out competed his old company to pieces  He took everything he knew from the old company and not only reimplemented it  he fixed the broken parts   And when the big payout came  he did not have to share with anyone  Last I spoke to him  he has a lovely wife and is quite happy   Business building is about relationships in no small way  When you start a company  keep that in mind  and choose wisely who you want to be that close to you 
286,360,7,EVALUATING STARTUP IDEAS,The only true currency we humans have is time  Everybody is given a pot of time when they are born  and every day they take out a little from it  One dreaded day  the pot is empty   People will pay money to have a little more of that precious time  So many modern fortunes have been made with products that save people time  like the automobile or the telephone   The best way to evaluate the value of a startup is by looking at the value of the time it saves  If it costs  100 hour to produce a screwdriver  and you are able to save 2 hours of that time with a product of yours  then every reasonable company would pay at least  100 to purchase that product   That is the essence of many software business  Save a business or person some time  so they can go make more money  The value of the time you save is basically the value you can extract for that business     Evaluation Framework  https   markessien com content images 2015 11 0 50Gvmue3SqekS13M png   The chart above demonstrates this  You can calculate the value your startup creates by filling in the numbers for the chart   For example  lets look at the chart for the invention of the car  The car significantly increased the speed at which travel could be done  It also did this for something that was done very often  travel  and done by basically everyone  So the value generated by the car was huge

421,506,1614,Communication,Every day communication evolves not just in the way we say things  But effective communication comes with doing In the theatrics of our world even silence is communicating something  More people spend extra algorithm to get the perception of buyer to predict what buyers frequently buy so they can better communicate to the needs of the buyer     We live in a world now  Where scarier things are being done but when you talk about it  you are the scarier one  Behavioural psychologist spend time in neuron network to compute how the human brain works to predict behaviour some things are not so simple any more  We think we have communication but we have lost privacy because knowledge is not towards communicating but to use this knowledge to the advantage of the one who knows     I remember the behavioral story of the  free rider  problem  where nets was distributed to a community in Uganda  But they later asked them to pay a little for these mosquito net  Much of world operates like these  communication was free till they get a way to sensor it   Most people claim  fake news are being circulated but if its fake news why then are you worried about it  We lived in times before when people had good and bad reports but no one said it was fake news  Global claim to fruition is like this for me  we are in a time where if you give those free net to a couple of people  you have successfully communicated to all to pay for those nets  And if you deter others from this knowledge  all of a sudden you are the bitter one with anguish from the past  A word is enough for the wise is the better communication i can say now

806,911,457,SO FAR SO GOOD, p Its an honour I must say for me to be here and to be trained by such great minds  so far I have learnt to  p   p 1  Pay attention to detail  p   p 2  Never follow to crowd  p   p 3  Always read instructions before you begin a task or an assignment  p   p I trust that as classes has commenced I would be able to learn the following things amongst others  p   p 1  Have an insight on the most desirable IT path for me  p   p 2  Learn to code and be the best in the whatever field I choose  p   p 3  Learn work ethics and gain skills that would make me fit in in any IT settings  p   p Amongst the things I would love to see improve is  p   p 1  Communication  The chat room gets so rowdy that one easily misses important details  p   p 2 I wish the task and classes can be flexible for working class and students which I beleive make up a large number of the interns  p 
807,912,1043,CSS  The Best Thing Since Jollofrice,So far  i would like to liken HTML and CSS to building of a house  While HTML would include digging and laying of the foundation  setting of blocks  plastering and attaching windows  door etc  CSS is in charge of how everything will look like which include color of the house and material  font  position  shine and pattern  I also discovered that even though HTML can function without CSS  it looks shallow and not aesthetic  HTML without CSS is like the map of Africa without Madagascar        When I first started with the HTML  the resume looks horrible and the layout seem off  then i applied CSS synthases like position  margin  padding etc  And with CSS  I discovered that it more of an art that science  the more you try  the more it looks better and later realized that maybe you have overdone the design  Note to self to read up on design pattern articles and maybe explore some videos on youtube   After applying  deleting and reapplying  here is something I came up with       storage 1043 images img 8egsdpttqo png      storage 1043 images img zgvo4yy2sl png       You can reach on  UncleAbbey on  Slack  startng slack com  and  AbiodunSpeaks on  Twitter  www twitter com abiodunspeaks 
808,916,455,Spicing things up with CSS,CSS is one of my favourites     It s so great making something that was previously ugly into something that s much less ugly  dare I say beautiful   And the magic that people can and have done with CSS makes me want to become so much better so that I can one day dazzle millions with the craziest website designs you ever saw  lmao  as if                  The difficulty    Doing this task wasn t particularly difficult  not anywhere near the  difficulty  of the previous task  In that task  tables were a hassle  HTML tables are great when you need to make tables  When you don t  while powerful  they quickly become confusing  And that s what s great about CSS  You can  technically  order your HTML however you want and then completely transform it with CSS  though  obviously  it s best to keep the order predictable             Getting rid of the table    Was my favourite thing  lol  I couldn t wait to leave that clunky mess and start using proper semantic HTML5 tags  I have so many articles and sections now  And even more headers probably  I m too lazy to check   And now that the table was gone  I could order the content much more naturally and didn t need placeholder comments for missing cells or rowspans or whatever             And the colours             Finally  it s no longer a bland  feelingless blob of text  It lives              Results    After all the madness  I managed to get to this        storage 455 images img afisor9nlo png   from this        storage 455 images img z2tyrjyauh png   which  in my opinion  is a big improvement       And  another cool thing  I got my HTML down from 167 lines to 124  that s how bulky the tables were  and I still have so many non necessary tags for no reason in particular        This was fun and I m looking forward to the team task

815,934,147,CSS  The HTML filigree ,Before 1996  web pages were shabby  odd looking and totally boring  Web developers had a hard time in making their pages attractive  Early October in the year 1996  Hakon Wium Lie  Tim Berners Lee co creator of the World Wide Web came to the rescue of web developers   by inventing a new technology which is now popularly known as CSS  CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets which literally means using style sheets to abrogate the default style of the HTML pages  CSS beautifies web pages and make it look enticing   Below is a comparison between a plain HTML web page and a page already styled with CSS        storage 147 images img hlmqs7bpmj png   BASIC HTML PAGE        storage 147 images img 017mwkdrf3 png               HTML page styled with CSS

817,936,383,MY HNG JOURNEY SO FAR,_Wow    It has been a great and lovely experience so far right from the day I was being onboarded on slack  Though with an intermediate level of knowledge in programming  I must confess I have learnt alot in the shortest period of time I came onboard this platform   _

819,938,892,THE BIGGER PICTURE WITH CSS,CSS means  Cascading Style Sheet   Cascading style sheets are used to change the layout of Web pages  CSS can be used to define styles suitable to make a web page user friendly and colourful         CSS helps to create a uniform look cutting across several pages of a Web site  It makes it possible to define the style of each table and each block of text within a page s HTML  styles that are used more often than usual are defined only once  in a CSS document       CSS makes it easy to change styles across several pages at once  For example  a Web developer may want to change the default h1 tag by adding some color to it  from a colour black to a color green for over twenty pages of a Web site  If the pages all point to the same style sheet  the colour only needs to be changed on the style sheet and all the pages will show the color green       While CSS is great for creating text styles  it is helpful for formatting other aspects of Web page layout as well  For example  CSS can be used to define the padding  margin and border around images or text or other object   CSS gives Web developers more exact control over how Web pages will look than HTML does  This is why most Web pages today adopt cascading style sheets to build their web sites       Below is an example of how CSS transforms a web page from its normal Mark Up to something more interesting and defined            storage 892 images img 1xdp7zybz3 png

852,982,2,YOUR HIGH IQ WILL KILL YOUR STARTUP, p In 2004 I was in Brazil  walking down the hill in Lapa to get some lunch  I was with a friend who I had met in the hostel I was staying   his name was Ofer  We were having a discussion about intelligence  and what role it plays in success   p   p Then out of the side of the road stepped a man  He was holding a knife in one hand and a bottle in the other hand  He spoke to us in fast Portuguese  clearly asking us to hand over the things we held  I stood there  not very sure what to do  Ofer started speaking quickly to the man  telling the man not to rob us   p   p What you have to know about Ofer is that he had been an Israeli soldier  He hated violence of any form  but he knew how to be violent   p   p The man threw the bottle on the floor and it broke into pieces  he picked up the bottle and lunged at us  I ran a short distance off  and Ofer stood there and dodged the man  all the while talking to him  The man attacked several times  and each time Ofer just moved aside   p   p Then finally  Ofer kicked the weapons out of the guys hands  punched him  and he fell  He then told me to run  and we ran down the hill to the restaurant   p   p We sat there and he continued what we had spoken about  He said  That demonstrates what I mean  The man with the knife did not know how to use that knife  If he had been as trained in knife fighting as I was in hand combat  he would have been able to destroy me  But he had a tool that he felt gave him an advantage  but it s nothing compared to a person who has no tool  but has worked to develop what he has   p   p Intelligence is like a knife  If you are intelligent  you are at a clear advantage against people who are not intelligent  But if you are intelligent  and another person is not as intelligent  but the other person is willing to train harder than you  the other person will very quickly overtake you in ability   p   h3  strong HOW YOUR INTELLIGENCE WILL DESTROY YOU  strong   h3   p People who are born intelligent start off life with everything easy for them  They don t have to work hard to get good grades  they never really have to do much to get ahead  The major challenge of early life is school   and school is designed for average people  So intelligent people just breeze through   p   p But there is a point where every intelligent person faces something that requires more than intelligence  It requires hard work  it requires the ability to fail  it requires being able to do tough tasks  boring tasks  For the first time in their life  in spite of their intelligence  these intelligent people are challenged  and they start failing  Like when they first attempt to create a start up   p   p And that s where most of them retreat  They focus on things they can t fail on  and ignore the other important things  They start to blame other things  like the school system   They procrastinate  They refuse to face new problems because they know they will not be able to handle them  and this does not fit into their worldview that they are invincible   p   p Let me tell another story  In 2007  I had dinner with the father of my girlfriend in Paris  He is currently a vice president at one of the top 5 consulting companies in the world  He is a Jewish french immigrant from Morocco   he came in the 70s to France with no money and no connections  and he made it up to become Vice President  even though he studied to be an engineer   p   p I asked him  How did you do it  How did you start from being an immigrant to become executive material  He told me  I got this far because I m intelligent  He continued  But there were many many people as intelligent as I am who graduated together with me  They are still engineers right now  The difference between me and them is that when I arrived  I knew that I did not have family here in France  I did not have connections  And I knew there were a lot of other people as intelligent as I was  and who had all these advantages  The only way to be successful then would be to gain a slight advantage over them   I had to work and train harder than they did  I had to get to know more people than they did  I had to learn more about more things that they did   p   p We started off equals  but at some point all the effort I put in started to pay off  and where they stopped improving themselves  I continued  and I got better and better  Where they were afraid to try new things because they would fail  I tried and I got better and knew more  till I was good enough for the job I hold now   p   h2  strong HOW THIS RELATES TO YOU  strong   h2   p Being intelligent is like having a knife  If you train every day in using the knife  you will be invincible  If you think that just having a knife will make you win any battle you fight  then you will fail  This believe in your own inherent ability is what will kill your start up  Success comes from the work and ability you put in becoming better than the others  and not from some brilliance you feel you may have within you   p   p So don t believe that the brilliance of your idea is what will make you successful  What will make you successful is when you are out there every day  doing something new  challenging yourself  trying new methods  studying new ways  having a lot of small failures  then getting better every day   p 
853,983,2,A CHINESE VILLAGER WHO SELLS MORE SOFTWARE DAILY THAN YOU DO, p I was alone in the center of a small Chinese town  the weakly glowing streetlights hardly illuminating the streets  The silence was heavy and absolute  It was different from the eternal light and sound of Shenzhen  and the high elevation gave the air an unusual taste  Things were not the same up here in the mountains  and this strangeness seemed a bit menacing  The roads had been tarred  courtesy of the rich central government who gave special attention to the Chinese minorities  but the villages up here in the mountains of Yunnan province did not have many cars to wear down the roads  So they felt incomplete  and leaves lay about  their crushing beneath my feet giving my walk a strange soundtrack   p   p A group of men sat in a doorway smoking tobacco from a big bong  watching me walk past with impassive faces  I hurried a bit  What I was looking for was near  I knew  I turned a corner into a small side street  and saw it   the red and blue glow of the humming fluorescent lights  the pictures of the scantily clad lady with big breasts  I had found the local internet cafe   p   p I walked in through the narrow doorway  squeezing past a young teenage couple holding hands and staring out of the door  The guy had a scar across his forehead  I wondered idly what their story was  it may have been an amazing love story  it could have been endlessly tragic  perhaps they were completely boring  I ll never know  because I walked into that room and was hit by the combined glow of hundreds of computer screens  different figures danced across many screens in some dance dance revolution clone  colourful websites reflected off the eyes of engrossed guys  smoking men scrolled through the news  cliques of teens starred together at a screen and shouted and laughed  The room was huge and it was filled with people surfing the internet and playing games  The internet cafe  long thought to be dead  had simply retreated here into the mountains  and it fed the local population with all the entertainment they could not afford to have at home   p   p After the necessary registration with my passport at the counter  I bought an entire night of internet surfing  starting off by checking what was new at techcrunch  I went through the usual schedule of websites I read  skipping only facebook and twitter  as they don t work here   p   p Being the only foreigner in there  I was getting a lot of looks  giggles and yelled out  HELLOs  from the kids around  I expected them to come talk to me at some point  so when someone tapped my shoulder  I was suprised that rather than some spiky haired teenager  it was a somewhat middle aged smiling man with a cigarette dangling from his lip  He introduced himself with the sentence   TechCrunch is my favorite website  too   His english was heavily accented  but good   p   p I simply looked up at him  unsure what to reply  I didn t need to say anything  because he started talking to me about the last few articles he had read on TechCrunch  I got only a few sentences in  mostly in agreement with his somewhat unusual but pretty insightful opinions about what they wrote  He spoke as if he had never spoken to anyone about TechCrunch  and needed to get all his thoughts out   p   p After 30 minutes of mostly listening  he invited me out to have a drink with him and his friends  He excitedly made phone calls in the local dialect and we went out  We walked over to some local food place  and sat outside on plastic chairs  several beers quickly appearing on the table  Soon  several of his friends popped in a shinily new BYD car  and they joined me   p   p He told me what he does  he sells software  And he sells a lot of software  Every month  he makes more than  5000  which is more than 50 times the average salary where he lives  He told me how he does it  and it s a bit unusual   p   p He had learnt how to program from a friend of his  They had both moved to Kunming and started working  but when his dad got sick  he had to go home and farm to keep the family alive  His dad was sick for close to a year  and they needed money  Unable to travel  he had started looking for jobs on Odesk  Rentacoder and such sites based on recommendation from his friend  After writing some software for a client  he noticed something important   p   p  em If he simply looked at the list of software projects available for jobs  he would have ideas on what software to develop   em   p   p He did this  and rather than making software for clients  he created his own software products  which he put on the internet  He said that 3 days after he copied a simple idea from the rentacoder list on his website  he was making 2 sales a day   20 per day  which basically doubled his monthly earnings as a farmer  He continued working on more products and copying more ideas  and soon he had 10 different software that he was selling  Sales were low at the start  but even then for him it was a lot of money   p   p He kept doing this  cloning software he found that people wanted by looking at open projects on rentacoder  most of his software being related to video encoding  Additionally  he would take open source software  change the way it looked and sell it online  He said he d get a few refunds  but most people would purchase it without complaining  He said he tried selling Firefox for a while  but sales were very low due to the free competition   p   p At the moment he s making more than  5 000 a month  and he s been making it for more than 4 years already  He s one of the bigger players in the video encoding software market   p   p As I left  he dropped me off at the local hotel where my friends were  He shook my hand enthusiastically and said he would email me  but that he had to sleep now  because he had to go to the farm early the next morning  Surprised  I asked him why he still farmed  He shrugged and lifted his palms in that typical smiling manner that the villagers there have   No why   he said   I enjoy farming    p 
854,984,2,BUILD AROUND YOUR DISCOVERY MECHANISM, p When you launch your web application  desktop software or any other type of software  the biggest problem you are going to face is very simple  but very hard to solve  People will not find your application   p   p For example  imagine Mr  Huang opens a shoe store and puts it in the corner of the town  in an area where there is no foot traffic  Very few people will find it  he goes broke  and he soon closes down  Mr  Rubenstein  on the other hand  puts the same shoe store on a busy shopping street  People are already there  all he needs to do them is add incentives for them to come in  The first guy has two problems  no people  no incentives  the second guy has one problem only  and he can easily test out different incentives to find the best one   p   p There may be a guy somewhere in Alaska who really really needs your software  You may really really need his money  But he will never find you  This is what will crush your product   the great big silence after launch   p   p Assuming you have not yet started working on your product  there is one thing that will make your life so very much easier  build around your discovery mechanism  Build on a busy shopping street  and not out in the corner of the town   p   p First of all  be very very clear on how you want users to discover your application  Then develop this part first  Then build everything else on top of that  If your application does not match your discovery mechanism  then change one of the two   p   p For example  if you are planning to gain users by search engine traffic  then make sure your product generates a lot of web pages  make sure the webpages interlink  study SEO FIRST  and THEN build your product   p   p If you plan to gain users by word of mouth  then focus on polishing the user experience  People will only recommend highly polished and non frustrating software  Be sure to have some communication method with the initial crop of users   p   p If you plan to gain users by viral growth  then make sure virality is fundamental to your application  and not tacked on   p   p If you plan to gain users because you are in a closed eco system like the Apple app store or Facebook  then find out the fundamental properties of these eco systems  and make sure these are part of your app  For example  in the app store  you should cross promote apps  In facebook  your apps should require more than one person to be useful   p   p Be very clear on how you want your apps to be discovered  Then build your application around this  otherwise your chance of just being ignored is high   p   p Have you ever noticed that a lot of the time several asian restaurants will open right next to each other on the same street  instead of in some other  unserviced  part of town  They do that because in order to survive  they need to be discovered  otherwise they will be killed by the great silence   p 
855,985,2,DON T ASK WHY YOU WERE REJECTED, p I ve noticed something that is not immediately obvious   rejections without explanations can be supremely helpful   p   p Imagine you are applying for a job  or for funding for a project of yours  You are confident going in   everything seems to be in place  and you are sure you will get accepted  But then you get rejected  The first question you will ask is   why  You want to know from the person exactly why you were unsuitable   p   p If the other party  however  does not give any reasons why you were rejected  this can be valuable to you  When people get rejected  they tend to reevaluate their initial concept under very critical eyes  What seemed perfect going in now seems riddled with flaws that could have been responsible for the rejection  The scales fall of their project and they can see it clearly  They fall out of love  and suddenly the lines on their lovers face are visible  and the once charming idiosyncrasies have become ugly flaws   p   p Being rejected without explanation allows people re see their project and potentially abandon it or change it into something better  Being rejected with explanations gives them false hope   they focus then on only that small flaw that was pointed out to them and think fixing it would solve the problem   p   p But often  the explanation given is diplomatic and designed not to burn bridges  it s not actual helpful advice that one can work on  So a rejection  em with  em  reason can unnecessarily extend a project that should rightfully be dead  Or it could cause an over focus on this one area  and all of the other flaws that were not listed in the reason  like personality flaws   go completely unworked on   p   p Getting rejected without reason is the best type of rejection  because it forces you to improve all aspects of your project  For a while  it allows you think and actually understand the problem  That s because you ll discover the problem by yourself   p 
856,986,2,THE SUNFLOWER, p A field of sunflowers sat beside another field covered with grass  Perhaps long ago that grass field was a pasture for animals  but now there was nothing there except an old tractor in the corner   p   p An unusual gust of wind  going against the direction the wind usually went in that area  lifted a few sunflower seeds from a particularly full sunflower  and dropped them in the grassy field   p   p All but one died very quickly  the tangle of the grass preventing them from taking root  One particularly hardy  or perhaps lucky  sunflower seed  however  defied the odds and started to grow   p   p On a fine morning  that sunflower bloomed and showed its bright yellow face  As the light hit it  it became aware of where it was  It looked around at all the whispering grass  and knew already  it was different  The belief grew stronger and stronger  till one day  it broke through all the grass and it saw across to the sunflower field   p   p What joy it felt in its heart in that moment  It saw all the other sunflowers  yellow and glorious  so different from the grass that had surrounded it  Once in a while  the wind would bring the glorious singing of those sunflowers across  and this lone sunflower rejoiced at those voices  so different from the raspy whispering of the grass around it   p   p But it wondered   look how big and glorious those sunflowers are  And I am so small and misshapen  They sing so wonderfully  while my voice is cracked and muted   p   p The sunflower grew sadder and sadder by the day  and at some point  thought that that must be the reason he was sent to this grassy field   he did not fit in with the glory of all the other sunflowers  He watched little sunflowers grow big and bloom  while his petals stayed small and stunted   p   p Then he figured it out  The reason he was small and stunted was because he was in the grassy field  If he could go over to the other field  then he would be in the soil that was best for sunflowers and he would grow to be as magnificent as they were   p   p Being a plant  he was not sure how exactly he could go about moving to another field  So he asked a knot of grass close by    Hey  do you know how I can go across to the other field    p   p The grassy lump looked at him in silence for a while   Sunflower  you ve never spoken to us all this while you have been growing here  We are your neighbours  we ve lived together all our lives  Why do you want to leave us and go live with the other sunflowers   p   p We ve heard you complain for so long about how small your petals are  and how great the sunflowers over there are doing  You know why your petals are so small and stunted   p   p Because  Sunflower  you have turned your head to look to that field  You are a sunflower  look at the sun  All the looking into the other field is what has prevented you from being as magnificent as they are  Just turn to the sun and forget about the other field    p   p The Sunflower  ashamed  saw that the grass was right  And he turned to the sun  In a few days  he bloomed and started growing  Soon  his petals were as big as the grandest from the other field   all the grass had made his soil very fertile   p   p A few years later  that grassy field was filled with grand sunflowers   children of that original sunflower   all looking proudly to the sun  growing and singing   p   p Till one day  again  another seed floated gently on an unusual gust of wind  into the next grassy field   p
